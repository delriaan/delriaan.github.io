<span class="decorativeText">Welcome back!</span>

In <a href="../what" target="blank">Part 2</a>, we discussed the quantitative building blocks of the problem statement we‚Äôve been working with. In this final article, I‚Äôll cover the *how* of the problem statement, focusing on considerations of both design and implementation of the deliverable.

First, let‚Äôs review the key criteria governing how to display or interact with results:

- <span class="bigMath">`\(h_1\)`</span>: <span id="msg_h1">Results by month</span>

- <span class="bigMath">`\(h_2\)`</span>: <span id="msg_h2">Services and facilities</span>

- <span class="bigMath">`\(h_3\)`</span>: <span id="msg_h3">Member demographics</span>

The relevant part of the problem statement is as follows:

> `\(H\)`: <span class="quote">‚Äú‚Ä¶ I need to see results by month; all services received and corresponding facilities; and member demographics.‚Äù</span>.

In keeping with the theme of temporal concurrency, the focus will be to explore the effect of our **how** criteria in expressing `\(\Big\langle\)`
<span msg_id="g1">`\(\gamma_1\)`</span>,
<span msg_id="g2">`\(\gamma_2\)`</span>,
<span msg_id="g3">`\(\gamma_3\)`</span>,
<span msg_id="g4">`\(\gamma_4\)`</span>,
<span msg_id="g5">`\(\gamma_5\)`</span>
`\(\Big\rangle\)` and `\(\Big\langle\)`
<span msg_id="W">`\(W\)`</span>,
<span msg_id="o1">`\(\omega_1\)`</span>,
<span msg_id="o2">`\(\omega_2\)`</span>,
<span msg_id="o3">`\(\omega_3\)`</span>
`\(\Big\rangle\)` by
`\(\Big\langle\)`
<span msg_id="h1">`\(h_1\)`</span>,
<span msg_id="h2">`\(h_2\)`</span>,
<span msg_id="h3">`\(h_3\)`</span>
`\(\Big\rangle\)`:

- `\(f(W, \omega_i)\to \gamma_j;\)`: ***What*** derived from ***who*** and ***when***

- `\(g(\gamma_j, h_k):= R_{\gamma\times h}\)`: The `\(\gamma\)` by `\(h\)` report matrix defining ***how*** the metrics are aggregated.

Now for the fun part: If `\(h\)` were limited to `\(h_2\)` and `\(h_3\)`, the report matrix `\(R\)` would be quite straight-forward to derive, appropriately aggregating `\(\gamma_j\)` by each `\(h\)`.

**That‚Äôs not the fun part.** üòè

The fun part is taking into account `\(h_1\)`, a time-based requirement that adds a layer of complexity to the report matrix depending on the metric. For example, let‚Äôs consider <span msg_id="g4">`\(\gamma_4\)`</span>. This is a clean, easy metric to aggregate across each of `\(h_k\)`. In contrast, <span msg_id="g1">`\(\gamma_1\)`</span> presents a temporal **windowing** problem with respect to <span msg_id="h1">`\(h_1\)`</span> both <span msg_id="h1">`\(h_1\)`</span> involve windows of time:
