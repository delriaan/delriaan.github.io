Welcome back!

Before getting started, let's revisit out problem statement from the introduction:

```{r}
#| label: PROBLEM_STATEMENT
problem_statement
```

The conventions I'll use are also defined in the introduction [here](../introduction#definitions--conventions){target='_blank'}.

## When

Identifying the global temporal window ( $W$ ) is important as defines the frame of reference within which temporal relations are queried and transformed. It is the absolute governor of detecting *when* things take place.  In this case, the window is defined as all records having temporal columns or derived temporal measurements with at least *one* value falling within the period *2019-01-01* to *2020-12-31*:

[ $\forall W, D^Î» \Rightarrow D^\lambda_\Omega:= \Bigg\{\matrix{ W_\text{start} \le \delta^T \le W_\text{end},\enspace\enspace\#\delta^T= 1\\ \\ W_\text{start} \le \delta^T_\text{end} \wedge W_\text{end} \ge \delta^T_\text{start},\enspace\enspace\#\delta^T= 2 }\Bigg\}$ ]{.mathblock}

, where $D^\lambda$ is the data source for context $\lambda$ (i.e., *demographics*, *claims*, *prescriptions*) and $W$ the lower and upper dates of the global window. The first form of $D^\lambda$ above reflects the case of a *single* time column in $D$ and the second form when there are two.

```{r}
drop_hint("Regarding the second form:", context = "posthoc", toggleGroup = 0)
```

- It allows for a much more compact dataset. I recommend giving serious consideration to transforming the single-date form into the dual-date form, especially when most of $\delta^I$ is duplicative along $\delta^T$ (more on this in a future article)
- It allows for $\delta^T$ to extend outside of the bounds of $W$ while preserving the ability to detect temporal concurrency relative to $W$
- ***Do not*** use the following logic to detect concurrency of the dual-date form with $W$ (or any other dual-date range):<br>[ $(W_\text{start} \le \delta_\text{start} \le W_\text{end} ) \wedge (W_\text{start} \le \delta_\text{end} \le W_\text{end})$ ]{.mathblock} This logical statement **will** fail to capture cases where $\delta^T$ extends outside of $W$:<br><br>`r window_example.png`

## Who

The "Who" aspect of the problem statement consists of two detectable conditions (as indicated by the conjunction *"and"*) and a possible, third:

- [ $\omega_1$]{.bigMath}: ["... members between 30 and 50 years old"]{.speech #omega-1-def}
- [ $\omega_2$]{.bigMath}: ["... have had at least two Inpatient visits within a six-week period"]{.speech #omega-2-def}
- [ $\omega_3$]{.bigMath}: $f(\omega_1, \omega_2)$ &mdash; [hierarchical concurrency]{.speech #omega-3-def}

### [Age vs. Report Window]{#omega-1} ([ $\omega_1$]{.medMath omega_id=1}) 

[ $\omega_1$]{.medMath omega_id=1} is the first opportunity to greatly trim down your data pull.

```{r}
drop_hint("It also presents a great case-in-point as to why carefully reading over a request <i>before</i> thrashing away at the keyboard is important:", context = "posthoc", toggleGroup = 1)
```

- [ $\omega_1$]{.medMath omega_id=1} must qualified relative to [ $W$]{.medMath} and not ["as of today"]{.speech}. Granted: this is not *explicitly* stated, but think about it: ["... for the period between January first of 2019 and the end of 2020"]{.speech} is your cue. Of course, when in doubt, check with the requester just to be sure.
- [ $W$]{.medMath} covers *two* years which will result in *two* ages for each member not filtered out. **Question**: Which age should be returned at this point? My preference would be *neither* and instead return the dates of birth. *Age* is a derived measure and is only needed to qualify records at this point; *dates of birth* are the temporal attributes ([ $\delta^T$]{.medMath}) which should carried forward (I'll demonstrate this shortly).

[ &#10024; ]{.bigMath style="color:#330033; "} At this stage, we've defined the first portion of ["Who"]{.speech} is related to the problem statement. An advantage of starting in this manner is that a maximally large cohort has been defined and can be stored in a table to which subsequent data can more efficiently be joined. 

For the sake of demonstration, assume the existence of a member demographics table $(M)$. Satisfying [ $\omega_1$]{.medMath omega_id=1} results in our first dataset: $D^M:=\sigma_{\omega_1}(M)$
, where [ $\sigma$]{.medMath} represents a [*selection*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_(relational_algebra) "Selection (Relational Algebra)"){.speech target="_blank"} operation.

```{r}
break_time
```

### [Events vs. Report Window]{#omega-2} ([ $\omega_2$]{.medMath omega_id=2})

Now, we move on to defining ([ $\omega_2$]{.medMath omega_id=2}).  Assume a claims dataset $(L)$ containing multiple service types $(\delta^G: \text{Inpt}\in G)$. To satisfy this requirement, *three* conditionals need to be addressed:

```{r COND_I}
drop_hint("<b>c<sub>1</sub></b> &mdash; Has inpatient visits within <span style='font-family:Georgia;'>W</span>:"
          , context = "posthoc"
          , toggleGroup = 1
          )
```

[ $c_1:= W_\text{start} \le \dot{\delta^T} \le{W}_\text{end}; \enspace\dot{\delta^T}\equiv\text{service date}$]{.mathblock toggleGroup=1 context="posthoc"}

<br>
```{r COND_II}
drop_hint("<b>c<sub>2</sub></b> &mdash; Number of inpatient visits greater than one:"
          , context = "posthoc"
          , toggleGroup = 2
          )
```

[If dataset $L$ has well-defined indicators for admissions (and discharges), detecting distinct events is easy. For the sake of this scenario, I will assume this to be the case [[scenarios where the beginning and ending of a series are not well-defined will be covered in a separate article &mdash; eventually]]{.speech}:
[ $c_2:=\#\big(\dot{\delta^T|}c_1\big) > 1;\enspace\dot{\delta^T}\equiv\text{admission date}$]{.mathblock}
]{toggleGroup=2 context="posthoc" style="right:20px; "}

<br>
```{r COND_III}
drop_hint("<b>c<sub>3</sub></b> &mdash; Time between inpatient admissions less than or equal to six weeks:"
          , context = "posthoc"
          , toggleGroup = 3
          )
```

[
[ $c_3:=\big({\Delta\\^n}\dot{\delta^T}|{c_2}\big)\ge\text{42 days}$]{.mathblock}
[ ${\Delta\\^n}\dot{\delta^T}:={\dot{\delta^T}}_{i+1}-{\dot{\delta^T}}_i\Big|_{i=1}^{n-1},\enspace\text{ the time between successive admissions}$]{.mathblock}
]{toggleGroup=3 context="posthoc"}

<p></p>
```{r COND_ORDER}
drop_hint("Before moving on, I want to point out that for performance considerations, the order in which the conditionals are resolved can become very important.  Normally, I would first try the following:"
          , context = "posthoc"
          , toggleGroup = 4
          )
```


[&nbsp;&nbsp; **1<sup>st</sup> $c_1$:** This is the most restrictive and is easily accomplished with a join operation over datasets $M$ and $S$: $M \bowtie_{\theta \rightarrow \delta^I}{S}, \enspace\delta^I\equiv\text{member identifier}$<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; **2<sup>nd</sup> $c_3$:** Resolving $c_3$ gives you $c_2$ for free (I'll leave that as *"thought homework"* for you to ponder)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; **3<sup>rd</sup> $c_2$:** This is easily resolved by counting over $c_3$ and qualifying based on the prescribed threshold<br>
[The second and third steps can easily be flipped depending on the number of `TRUE` cases at each step. Use your domain knowledge (or someone else's) in these cases or, if all else fails, use multple trial-and-error runs on sampled data (sampling at the member level, in this case) to get a sense of which order will have the best performance on the full set of observations.]{.speech}
