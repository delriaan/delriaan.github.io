[Welcome back!]{.decorativeText} 

In [Part 1](../who-and-when){target="blank"}, we discussed the importance of giving proper treatment to understanding the *who* and *when* of a problem statement which provide the context within which a solution will be crafted. In this article, we'll discuss the quantitative building blocks of the problem statement itself.

```{r}
drop_hint("First, let's define the key measures and related metrics listed in the problem statement:", context = "posthoc", toggleGroup = 1) 
```

- [ $\gamma_1$]{.bigMath}: [Average length of stay]{#msg_1} $\\\gamma(x)=\bar{x};\enspace x := \big(t_{i+1}-t_{i}\big)$

- [ $\gamma_2$]{.bigMath}: [Counts of lapses in medication adherence]{#msg_2} $\\f(x)=\sum{x};\enspace x:=\Big\{\matrix{0, \text{No lapse}\\1, \text{Lapse}}$ (there's more to this operation which will be covered in Part 3)
  
- [ $\gamma_3$]{.bigMath}: [Cumulative count of lapses in medication adherence]{#msg_3} $\\f(\gamma_2, j)=\sum_{i=1}^{j}{\gamma_2|j\le{i}}$ (yes, I have not defined $j$: that will be covered in Part 3)

- [ $\gamma_{4}$]{.bigMath}: [Number of unique members]{#msg_4} $\\f(x)=\#x;\enspace x:=\text{the set of unduplicated member identifiers}$
  
- [ $\gamma_5$]{.bigMath}: [Total expenditures]{#msg_5} $\\f(x)=\sum{x};\enspace x:=\text{cost}$

Note that for each of metrics, a *metric* and a *measure* were defined. The measure is the content of the metric, while the metric operates on the measure.

>
For example, [ $\gamma_1$]{msg_id=1}'s measure is *days between dates* and the metric is *mean of {measure}*.


<hr style="width:100%">

Next, recall that the dimensions of the problem statement are the *who* and *when* of the problem statement. These were discussed in [Part 1](../who-and-when){target="_blank"}, so we won't go into them here. Instead, I want to prepare you for the next article in this series that addresses the *how* of the problem statement.

Recall the relationship between *metrics* and *measures*, the latter being content that is operated on by the former. What they often have in common is being able to be functionally expressed.

Using *"Average length of stay"* as an example, [ $\gamma_1$]{msg_id=1} can be written as follows:

**The measure:**

>
$f(t_{i+1}, t_i) := t_{i+1}-t_i \Rightarrow \mathbb{F}$

**The metric $(\gamma_1)$:**

>
$g(\mathbb{F}, k) := k^{-1}{\sum_{j=1}^{k}{\mathbb{F}_j}}\\ \enspace\enspace \equiv k^{-1}{\sum_{j=1}^{k}{\big(t_{i+1}-t_{i}\big)_j}}$

, where $k$ indexes the number of observations. 

[ $t$]{.bigMath} and [ $k$]{.bigMath} are the dimensions. Now, think about what influences the size of $k$ and the values in $t$ for each $k$ to feed into the metric (*who* and *when*). *Who* and *When* shape the input, while the metrics define *What* to do to the input. The final item to address is *How* to apply the metrics to the inputs given *Who* is involved and *When*.

In Part 3, we'll do just that [&#128578;]{style="font-size:larger;"}
