IntroductionNumerous articles have been published centered on data engineering and using data to satisfy a business inquiries. Best practices, techniques, and technology are inescapable concepts one will encounter. What I’d like to present are some design concepts drawn from my own experience specifically dealing with the time-centric aspects of data engineering in the context of deconstructing analytic problem statements.
This article serves as the introduction to a short series articles drawing from my experiences as a data practitioner, specifically focusing on lessons I’ve learned in dealing with temporal co-occurrence.</description>

And we’re back!
Be sure to check out Measurements of Scale part one, here. Now, we’ll tackle interval and ratio measurements.

A good understanding of measurements of scale (MoS) is essential in both metric design as well as conducting analytics in order to avoid misapplying mathematical operations to the wrong input type leading to misleading or incorrect inferences.

Focal Thoughts:1. Simply reporting a measure of central tendency presents an incomplete picture of the data under study2. Choosing the wrong “mean” can mean trouble3. The values in a dataset should not be interpreted apart from the real-world elements they encode
Average Value: Is it Informative?Inevitably, in reading anything involving reported statistics, the average value of some measurement will be reported. What exactly is being reported?</description>
