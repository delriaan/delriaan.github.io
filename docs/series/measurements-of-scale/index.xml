A good understanding of measurements of scale (MoS) is essential in both metric design as well as conducting analytics in order to avoid misapplying mathematical operations to the wrong input type leading to misleading or incorrect inferences. References are provided above, so I leave the reader to … well, read.</description>

Focal Thoughts: 1. Simply reporting a measure of central tendency presents an incomplete picture of the data under study 2. Choosing the wrong “mean” can mean trouble 3. The values in a dataset should not be interpreted apart from the real-world elements they encode
Average Value: Is it Informative? Inevitably, in reading anything involving reported statistics, the average value of some measurement will be reported. What exactly is being reported?</description>
