Before getting started, let’s revisit out problem statement from the introduction:
&#34;I want to know trends related to total cost of care; inpatient average lengths of stay; lapses in medication adherence; and member counts for the period between January first of 2019 and the end of 2020.</description>

      <description>## dataset-design-and-temporal-concurrencyIntroduction Numerous articles have been published centered on data engineering and using data to satisfy a business inquiries. Best practices, techniques, and technology are inescapable concepts one will encounter. What I’d like to present are some design concepts drawn from my own experience specifically dealing with the time-centric aspects of data engineering in the context of deconstructing analytic problem statements.
This article serves as the introduction to a short series drawing from my experiences as a data practitioner, specifically focusing on lessons I’ve learned in dealing with temporal co-occurrence.</description>
