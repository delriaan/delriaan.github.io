Sergey Shoigu, 68, a longstanding ally who has held the post since 2012.<br><br>Gen. Shoigu is set to be replaced as defense minister by Andrei Belousov, a former minister of economic development and deputy prime minister.<br><br>Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Belousov, 65, hails from a civilian rather than military background, but is said to be well-versed in military economics.<br><br>“The president has decided that a civilian should head up the defense ministry,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on May 13.<br><br>“On today’s battlefield, the winners are those who are more open to innovation,” he said.<br><br>According to Mr. Peskov, the defense ministry must be “totally open” to new technologies and novel means of ensuring economic competitiveness.<br><br>“For this reason,” he said, “the president has selected Mr. Belousov for the post.”<br><br>Ruslan Pukhov, director of the Moscow-based Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, said Mr. Belousov is known for applying cutting-edge innovations to state institutions.<br><br>“His innovative approach was the main reason behind his recent appointment,” Mr. Pukhov was quoted as saying by Russia’s TASS news agency.<br><br>“Implementation of new technologies in the military sphere will be one of his main tasks going forward,” he said.<br><br>In 2020, he was given the post of deputy prime minister.<br><br>Mr. Belousov is known to be ideologically close to Mr. Putin and reportedly shares the latter’s vision of building a strong Russian state and military.<br><br>He has also played a central role in overseeing Russia’s drone program, which—driven by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine—has advanced rapidly in recent years.<br><br>In his first public remarks since he was tapped for the post, Mr. Belousov stressed the need to improve conditions for rank-and-file Russian soldiers.<br><br>“It’s unacceptable that personnel taking part in the special military operation … are driven from civilian medical institutions to hospitals, which are often overcrowded,” he told parliament on May 13.<br><br>“This issue needs to be resolved,” he said.<br><br>In comments cited by local media outlets, Mr. Belousov also complained that excessive red tape was hindering payment of benefits to military personnel.<br><br>He also alluded to longstanding problems pertaining to housing and medical treatment for army veterans.<br><br>The remarks appeared to be aimed at showing military personnel that he understood their concerns and would work—if appointed—on improving their conditions.<br><br>Mr. Belousov’s likely appointment also signals Moscow’s desire to direct the weight of Russia’s economy, which has so far survived Western-led sanctions, toward the war effort.<br><br>Despite the toughest sanctions regime ever imposed on a major economy, Russian policymakers have proven adept at maintaining economic stability.<br><br>“War of attrition is won by economics,” Alexandra Prokopenko, a former Russian central bank adviser, said in a social-media post.<br><br>“Belousov is in favor of stimulating demand from the budget, which means military spending will not decrease, but increase,” she added.<br><br>His appointment is also likely to bring defense spending under greater scrutiny after Timur Ivanov, a deputy defense minister, was charged last month with taking millions of dollars worth of illicit kickbacks.<br><br>Gen. Shoigu will also reportedly remain in charge of certain aspects of Russia’s sprawling military-industrial sector, according to the Kremlin.<br><br>Mr. Patrushev, who has headed up the Security Council since 2008, will likely be appointed to another key position, which has yet to be announced.<br><br>“Nikolai Patrushev has been relieved of his post as head of the Security Council due to his transfer to another position,” Mr. Peskov told reporters on May 12.<br><br>“Within the next few days, we will inform you where he will continue his activities,” the spokesman added.<br><br>Mr. Putin’s recommendations are expected to come into effect once they are formally approved by parliament.<br><br>If implemented, they will be the biggest shake-up of Russia’s military command structure since Moscow launched its invasion of eastern Ukraine in early 2022.<br><br>The changes come within the context of an anticipated reshuffle by Mr. Putin, who won a fifth term as president—by a wide margin—in the March elections.<br><br>Meanwhile, several other leading officials in Russia’s military and security hierarchy are set to keep their current positions.<br><br>These include military chief-of-staff Valery Gerasimov and the directors of Russia’s Federal Security Service and Foreign Intelligence Service.<br><br>Sergey Lavrov, who has served as Moscow’s top diplomat since 2004, is also expected to remain in his current role."}]
