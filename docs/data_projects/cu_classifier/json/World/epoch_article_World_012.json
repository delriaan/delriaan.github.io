These are the ingredients of the next big minerals boom and my government is working to make it easier to find more and meet the world’s appetite for them,” Mr. Albanese said.<br><br>Earlier, the state government said it is investing $36.4 million to reduce green tape and speed up approvals as part of its ambitious reform agenda for job-creating projects, such as green energy projects.<br><br>“We’re really keen to reduce delays in getting new projects off the ground, which will help us remain the engine room of the national economy while also diversifying and setting it up for the future,” WA Treasurer Rita Saffioti said.<br><br>However, the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) said that while WA is the best performing state in terms of having the lowest energy price hikes, it is also concerning that its government is replacing affordable and reliable energy supply with unreliable and expensive renewables, similar to Victoria.<br><br>“Western Australia’s budget demonstrates the benefits of pragmatic economic management. However, examples from the east coast, particularly Victoria, are a lesson to avoid repeating in the West, where profligate spending, flawed energy policies and locking up natural resources have cruelled local economies,” Daniel Wild, IPA Deputy Executive Director, said.<br><br>“For Western Australia to remain prosperous, is it crucial that the state government continues to value and promote its resources sector and avoids repeating the mistakes that have been made in failing states like Victoria.”"}]
