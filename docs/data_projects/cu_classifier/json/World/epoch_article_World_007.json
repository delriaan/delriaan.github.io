Only 14 percent of Canadians said the economy was likely to strengthen in 2024.<br><br>The Nanos Pocketbook Index, which tracks public perception of personal finances and job security, also dropped during the first week of May. Sitting at 50, it matched the low hit during the height of the pandemic in April 2020, when Canada’s gross domestic product fell by 10.7 per cent.<br><br>That perception was especially low among the youngest respondents, with the index falling to 40 among those aged 18 to 29, the lowest recorded in the 16-year history of the index.<br><br>Employment gains were made by men and women aged 25 to 54, accounting for 41,000 or 0.6 percent increase among men and 27,000 or 0.4 percent for women. Younger people, aged 15 to 24, also saw employment numbers rise to 39,000 or 2.8 percent."}]
