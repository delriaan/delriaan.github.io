As we cross-check them, we update the numbers, and we'll continue to do that as that progresses.”<br><br>When asked about the reliability of the data, Mr. Haq said that the fact that the agency is “continually checking them” indicates that the numbers can still be deemed reliable.<br><br>The casualty numbers reported by news sources are unverified and may not include the number of terrorists killed in the war.<br><br>“This admission, which goes unnoted in OCHA publications or elsewhere, raises multiple methodological concerns,” the report reads.<br><br>“News reports are more likely to specify the number of women and children killed than men or combatants due to the dramatic nature of women and children’s deaths and local pressure to downplay Israeli actions against combatants.”<br><br>According to the report, the Gaza Health Ministry and GMO have regularly downplayed the fatality count of men, and “the general pattern of statistics shows an improbably low proportion of deaths among males.”<br><br>“Hamas’s GMO—part of the group’s propaganda machine—is particularly active in pushing the narrative that a large majority of deaths are women and children,” the report states."}]
