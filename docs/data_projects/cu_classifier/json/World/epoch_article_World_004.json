The framework, jointly agreed by the UK and the European Union, includes conditions that there can be no diminution of rights under the terms of Northern Ireland’s Good Friday Agreement.<br><br>The judge delivered the ruling in two challenges against the act, saying, “I have found that there is a relevant diminution of right in each of the areas relied upon by the applicants.”<br><br>“The applicants’ primary submission therefore succeeds. Each of the statutory provisions under consideration infringes the protection afforded to RSE [Rights, Safeguards, and Equality of Opportunity] in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement,” Mr. Justice Humphreys said.<br><br>Mr. Justice Humphreys placed a temporary stay on the disapplication ruling until a further hearing at the end of May, when applicants will have an opportunity to respond to the judgment.<br><br>Representing the government, Tony McGleenan, KC responded to the ruling in court, saying, “We’ll be taking our instructions on the judgment and the position in terms of any further litigation will become clear, my lord.”<br><br>Solicitor Sinead Marmion, representing the Iranian youth, said outside the courthouse afterwards that the judgment was “hugely significant” and claimed it would prevent the Rwanda scheme from applying in the country.<br><br>In comments emailed from the Downing Street press office to The Epoch Times, the prime minister said: “We continue to work to get regular flights off to Rwanda in the coming weeks and nothing will distract us from that or delivering to the timetable I set out. We must start the flights to stop the boats.<br><br>“I have been consistently clear that the commitments in the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement should be interpreted as they were always intended, and not expanded to cover issues like illegal migration. We will take all steps to defend that position, including through appeal.”<br><br>Gavin Robinson said, “It is imperative that immigration policy applies equally across every part of the United Kingdom.”<br><br>“As unionists, we are clear that our national Parliament should have the ability to make decisions on immigration that are applicable on a national basis.<br><br>“If that were not the case, it would not only be a constitutional affront but would make Northern Ireland a magnet for asylum seekers seeking to escape enforcement,” the DUP interim leader added."}]
