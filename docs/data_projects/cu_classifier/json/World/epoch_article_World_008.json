It noted, however, that “more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.”<br><br>Dr. Massie questioned whether the study by government scientists was interested in finding issues with vaccination and pregnancy given the the government was promoting mass vaccination.<br><br>After the results of the study were published on April 21, 2021 in the New England Journal of Medicine, other government advisory bodies recommended COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women.<br><br>Dr. Oldfield said Health Canada encouraging pregnant women to get vaccinated for COVID-19 could contradict “both the law with respect to false and misleading advertisements of a drug, and contradicts the safety data found on both the Moderna and Pfizer monographs.”<br><br>The Epoch Times asked Health Canada if it is allowed by law to make recommendations about the use of products for certain populations for which the products’ monographs do not indicate safety information. The Foods and Drugs Act states that “No person shall label, package, treat, process, sell or advertise any drug in a manner that is false, misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous impression regarding its character, value, quantity, composition, merit or safety.”<br><br>Health Canada spokesperson Anna Madison responded that “public health messages from a government authority that promote vaccination would not qualify as advertising of a health product.”<br><br>Despite different bodies’ recommendations for pregnant woman, NACI noted in a summer 2022 report that “uptake of COVID-19 vaccine has been lower among pregnant people compared to non-pregnant people in Canada.”<br><br>“Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/fetal development, parturition, or post-natal development, and human randomized clinical trials were not submitted for regulatory evaluation,” said Health Canada in responding to MP Carrie.<br><br>“There were no other indicators of mRNA-1273-related developmental toxicity observed, including delayed ossification; therefore, these common skeletal variations were not considered adverse,” concluded the manufacturer.<br><br>Health Canada responded that the product monographs for authorized COVID-19 vaccines “include a statement that it is unknown whether the COVID-19 vaccine is excreted in human milk.”<br><br>“A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded,” it adds.<br><br>Authors of the study published in the Lancet noted their “findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 vaccine mRNA is not confined to the injection site but spreads systemically and is packaged into [breast extracellular vesicles].”<br><br>The scientists said that since only “trace quantities” are present and a “clear translational activity is absent, we believe breastfeeding post-vaccination is safe, especially 48 h after vaccination.” They specified that since the minimum mRNA dose to elicit an immune reaction in young infants is unknown, breastfeeding mothers should consult with a health-care provider to discuss risks and benefits in the first two days after vaccination."}]
