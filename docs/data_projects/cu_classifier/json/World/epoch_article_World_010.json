At least three students detailed how Chinese police pressured their families into financially cutting them off.<br><br>One student in the UK said she had noticed people filming protest participants at several demonstrations she had attended, saying: “Every time, there is someone [we] don’t know filming. Standing to the side, using their phones and recording. They don’t say anything but stand there holding their phone.”<br><br>Another who took part in an off-campus pro-Hong Kong event in the UK in 2022 said a group of Chinese people had called the police on them.<br><br>In another instance, a student who had held up a sign in support of Hong Kong protesters was photographed the next day at Edinburgh airport “and targeted with death threats on Chinese social media platform Weibo,” the Amnesty report said.<br><br>Amnesty said that nearly half of the students they talked to were afraid their classmates might report their comments, “either by mistake or intentionally because they were ‘nationalists’ or were compelled to do so by Chinese authorities,” the report said, noting that this led to many students isolating themselves from their peers “and has caused others to avoid association with outspoken individuals, compounding a sense of loneliness during their studies.”<br><br>Several interviewees studying in Europe said they had received “verbal threats or warnings” from fellow Chinese students, “including, in some cases, a threat to report them to Chinese police.”<br><br>In Europe, a pro-CCP student asked their university professor for the names of individuals who had raised China-related human rights issues during class, such as on the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities like the Muslim Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region. The tutor had declined.<br><br>Mr. Deshmukh said it was “obvious” the regime was trying to replicate “the climate of fear which gags people in China and Hong Kong making students terrified of how they are being perceived and suspicious of their fellow students.”<br><br>The Amnesty International UK chief executive called on British universities to “understand the dangerous realities Chinese students face from China’s transnational repression, making it clear that they’ll prioritise Chinese and Hong Kong students’ safety and freedoms.”<br><br>The Epoch Times contacted Universities UK and the Russell Group for comment."}]
