That probe found no evidence of wrongdoing. But inquiries into the investigation’s origin exposed a bias-tainted operation premised on lies funded by a political opponent.<br><br>The issues these incidents raise are larger than politics. They go to the core of what America stands for.<br><br>The United States is the standard-bearer for fundamental rights. A functional justice system differentiates us from dictatorial regimes.<br><br>The raid on Trump based on allegations surrounding his handling of government records, which he as president had the authority to declassify, has further divided the country.<br><br>If the goal of a politicized raid was to reduce support for the former president, it appears to have had the opposite effect. In the wake of the raid, protests were held across the country. Even those who politically oppose Trump have condemned the search.<br><br>Meanwhile, in anticipation of congressional investigations should the majority shift this November, Republican lawmakers have asked the leaders of the FBI and the Department of Justice to preserve records related to the raid.<br><br>Amid the controversy, our nation is facing enormous external threats. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) works unceasingly toward its stated goal of destroying America.<br><br>While the FBI has recently, and rightly, pursued cases and investigations against CCP agents operating on U.S. soil, the agency is now finding itself losing the trust of tens of millions.<br><br>America needs to be strong to face this threat. To be strong, we need to heal our internal divisions. Further politicization of federal agencies achieves the opposite effect.<br><br>How do we move forward as a country when the rule of law seems to be unevenly applied, causing trust in our institutions to fade?<br><br>The appearance of politics tainting prosecutorial decision-making is a dangerous trajectory for America and the world.<br><br>Sunlight is the best disinfectant. As a starting point, the government should be fully transparent about the Mar-a-Lago raid. Full disclosure would be a step in the right direction, helping to lower the temperature of the nation."}]
