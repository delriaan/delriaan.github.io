The leaders have previously addressed critical issues such as debt crises, oil embargoes and shortages, the COVID-19 pandemic, and various aspects of G7 relations with communist China.<br><br>There was much more focus on matters such as human rights, peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and militarization of the South China Sea. These areas of concern have been addressed in various ways in G7 statements over the past several years, with Chinese state-run media breathlessly echoing complaints expressed thereafter by Chinese diplomats and others.<br><br>Right on cue on April 23, The Wall Street Journal reported on “the fourth arrest of an alleged China spy in Germany in 24 hours.” The article quoted the German interior minister: “If it is confirmed that China’s intelligence services had spies in the European Parliament, then we’re talking of an attack on European democracy from within.” The investigation is ongoing, but this spate of “caught Chinese spies” would appear to put an exclamation point on the G7 leaders’ statement.<br><br>Those were just the latest spy-catching incidents in Europe, as Politico-Europe previously reported on ubiquitous Chinese spies in Brussels: “As many as one in five of the Chinese journalists working in Brussels are suspected to be intelligence officers, according to the Belgian security services. Indeed, so many Chinese spies are suspected of operating in Brussels that some treat it as a kind of a joke.”<br><br>Three days later, Global Times quoted Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, who claimed that the G7 statement was “a deliberate mischaracterization of the facts and truth, and a blatant interference in China’s internal affairs.” Wang further spun the G7’s criticism by claiming that, under the new national security Law, “Hong Kong has restored order and is set to thrive, and Xinjiang and Xizang [Tibet] enjoy social harmony, prosperity and stability where people of all ethnic groups live a happy life.”<br><br>For example, he noted that “Chinese subsidies [of the auto industry] range from interest rates of zero or below, and subsidized steel and batteries for electric cars, to direct government support,” resulting in the dumping of Chinese-built electric vehicles on the global market at “far below the cost of production.”<br><br>The result? A quintupling of Chinese auto exports over the last three years directly due to these unfair trade practices. That is what Xi means by “cooperation with Chinese characteristics.”<br><br>No wonder communist Chinese caterwauling about G7 public statements increasingly fall on deaf years!"}]
