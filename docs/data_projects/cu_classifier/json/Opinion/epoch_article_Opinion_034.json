Should borrowers default and banks resort to property foreclosures, they may incur losses amid the market slowdown. With fewer loans recovered, banks have less capital available for lending. Banks may become more cautious about lending in the real estate sector, limiting funding for new development projects. This also means that Beijing cannot use real estate development to spend its way out of its current economic downturn.<br><br>The benefit of securitization is that banks can recover some of the cash they loaned out. It also distributes the risk across multiple investors who buy the securities. However, it does not eliminate the bad debts or the underlying problems in the Chinese economy that led borrowers to default. Another concern with securitization is that it exacerbates the opacity issues already present in China’s banking system. Once the debts are securitized and sold, tracking and quantifying the percentage of NPLs or the actual risk banks are exposed to becomes nearly impossible, as does assessing the severity of the economy’s situation based on the percentage of individuals unable to repay their loans.<br><br>Distributing the risk may seem like a good idea, but it can result in contagion. NPL-backed securities carry high risk due to the probability of borrower defaults. This scenario mirrors the global financial crisis, where mortgage-backed securities were created from bundles of subprime mortgages—home loans granted to borrowers unable to afford them. These securities were then sold to investors who underestimated the associated risks.<br><br>The housing market bubble eventually burst, causing a decline in property prices. Consequently, there was a sharp increase in defaults on subprime mortgages, causing the value of mortgage-backed securities to plummet. By securitizing the mortgages and selling them to investors, the risk was transferred from banks to other sectors of the economy, such as pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, and individual investors, both large and small.<br><br>In conclusion, China’s economy is clearly slowing down. This is evident from declining consumer and home sales, as well as increasing defaults. Regardless of the Chinese Communist Party’s approach to addressing the non-performing loan percentages on paper, the underlying causes persist, ranging from declining exports and factory activity to the aging crisis, debt bubble, and decreasing foreign direct investment. Attempting to conceal the evidence will not eradicate the underlying problems."}]
