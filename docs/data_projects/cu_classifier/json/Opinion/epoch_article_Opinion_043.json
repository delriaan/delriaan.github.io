A dollar buys more yuan now, so goods priced in yuan become a bargain for Americans. The problem, however, is that imports must be paid in dollars. This includes nearly all commodities and energy. Consequently, a weak yuan makes it more expensive for Chinese factories to purchase raw materials and power their machines.<br><br>The other reason that there is little hope for the yuan’s recovery is that the dollar is so high and will most likely remain there for the foreseeable future. When U.S. interest rates are high, as they have been for nearly a year, the dollar increases in value. Capital generally flows out of China and other countries as investing in the United States becomes more lucrative. Chinese investors can earn 5 percent by depositing their U.S. dollars in the United States. They would gain only 1.5 percent interest if they converted them to yuan and deposited them at home.<br><br>The flow of investment out of China and other countries and into the United States causes the yuan and other currencies to depreciate while further strengthening the dollar. The dollar may lose value if interest rates come down. However, given the persistent inflation in the United States, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates. So the smart money is being moved out of yuan and into dollars or gold.<br><br>The yuan will have a long way to go to replace the dollar, and the first step will be for Chinese exporters to hold the yuan, which they are currently unwilling to do."}]
