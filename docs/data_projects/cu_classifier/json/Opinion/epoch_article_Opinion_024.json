If I hadn’t turned away from the left 25 or 30 years ago, I could have made some serious bank.<br><br>Who knows? I might even be a tenured professor of “creative writing” at Brown University with a three-picture deal at Warner Brothers (not likely, but making a point here).<br><br>I was reminded of that most obvious of secrets—that communism, Marxism, and socialism are really about keeping money, actually growing money and power, in the hands of “elites” with the working class pounding sand—when reading the Undercover Mother’s Substack on May 3.<br><br>I would imagine today they would have sent me anyway because public schools are now considered by the upper classes to be worthless, and, for Republicans (my parents were Democrats), dangerous centers of extreme woke indoctrination.<br><br>But, as the Undercover Mother shows us, it’s almost the reverse. The so-called elite schools are the true hotbeds of radical indoctrination, the better, as the wolf might say to Little Red Riding Hood, to prepare you for your proper role in society, brainwashing and oppressing the masses. This, parenthetically, is how you will get rich and stay happy.<br><br>Undercover Mother also reminds us that this is all quite well organized:<br><br>Where does the money for NAIS (and just about everything else on the left) come from? I would refer you to the title of her article. The George in this case is not the Georges Seurat of “Sunday in the Park with George,” but the George Soros of the euphemistically named Open Society Foundation. (It is everything but.)<br><br>What NAIS and others are creating in these secondary institutions are essentially feeding schools for the campus chaos we are seeing all around us.<br><br>These schools and the universities themselves are forms of socialism, with the professors profiting from the system. It should be no surprise then that they largely back and often even applaud the demonstrating students whose puerile beliefs echo what they have been hearing in the classroom.<br><br>So who does that mean makes the serious bank I referred to above? Again, we find a clue at Undercover Mother:<br><br>Mr. Ayers and his wife, Bernadine Dohrn, of the Weather Underground, it’s worth recalling, were said to have been babysitters for Barack and Michelle Obama back in the day. And where is the formerly terroristic Ms. Dohrn now? Wikipedia has an answer:<br><br>Ah, to be rich and Marxist! You get to live a cushy life while pretending to yourself you are doing the “right thing.”<br><br>Do I sound jealous? In my darkest moods, I would have to admit that I am. Although I never joined Weather, I knew those who did, or at least sympathized with the bombers.<br><br>That was a road not taken for me, and thank G-d for that.<br><br>But it is interesting to see, and worth keeping in mind, what an upper-class or upper-middle-class (i.e., elitist) phenomenon leftism is, from Karl Marx’s time up through ours.<br><br>I doubt that his life or his now classic book that President Ronald Reagan credited as having moved him from a Democrat to a Republican are taught or even mentioned at any of the NAIS schools. Their narrative might go on tilt."}]
