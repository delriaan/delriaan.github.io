During his time as a full-time teacher, Mr. Billard mainly taught drama. As a substitute he primarily taught English, although he occasionally substituted for teachers of religion classes.<br><br>According to Mr. Billard, he announced his engagement to his partner on social media in October 2014, which, he said, led to termination of his employment two months later. The now retired teacher married his partner in 2015.<br><br>Following the termination of his contract, he filed a discrimination complaint with the EEOC, followed by an employment discrimination lawsuit in 2017 against the school, as well as Mecklenburg Area Catholic Schools and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte."}]
