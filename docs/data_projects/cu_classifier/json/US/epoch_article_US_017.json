The convention’s purpose is to officially nominate President Trump as the Republican candidate for the 2024 presidential election.<br><br>The Republican National Convention is scheduled to be held in Milwaukee in mid-July.<br><br>On May 9, a list of 41 at-large delegates from Florida was revealed, including three of Trump’s children—Eric, Tiffany, and Donald Trump Jr. Mr. Eric Trump will serve as the state’s delegation chair. Ivanka Trump, the former president’s oldest daughter, was not included on the delegate list.<br><br>This would have been Mr. Barron Trump’s first public appearance in politics.<br><br>“The RPOF is ready for a great convention in Milwaukee, but more importantly, we are excited as we continue to lay the groundwork in Florida for success,“ Mr. Power wrote. ”Mark my words, we are going to win, and we will win big in November!”<br><br>When asked if the former president has warned Mr. Barron Trump about how “nasty” politics can be, President Trump said his 18-year-old son doesn’t have to “hear much” and has “seen it” for himself. Mr. Barron Trump even gives his dad some advice, according to the former president.<br><br>“He is a smart one. He doesn’t have to hear much,” President Trump said. “But he’s, he’s a great guy. He’s a little on the tall side. I will tell you, he’s a tall one, but he is a good-looking guy.<br><br>“And he’s really been a great student. And he does like politics. It’s sort of funny. He’ll tell me sometimes, ‘Dad, this is what you have to do.’<br><br>“He’s a senior now in high school, and he’ll be going to college.”<br><br>Last month, the former president asked Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over his “hush money” trial, to give him permission to miss a day in court to attend Barron’s high school graduation on May 17. Judge Merchan eventually granted his request and said his court wouldn’t be in session that day, allowing the defendant to attend the graduation.<br><br>Previously, Judge Merchan was reluctant to allow the former president to attend the ceremony, which drew the ire of President Trump. This incident thrust the younger Mr. Trump into the headlines.<br><br>Mr. Barron Trump was only 10 years old when his father was elected to the White House in 2016. During his father’s tenure, he was mostly kept away from the public spotlight.<br><br>Representatives for the former first lady’s office and the RNC didn’t respond by press time to requests by The Epoch Times for comment."}]
