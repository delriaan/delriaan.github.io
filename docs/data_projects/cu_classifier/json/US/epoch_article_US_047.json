The Mountain View High School and the Honey Run Elementary School will go back to being named Stonewall Jackson High School and Ashby-Lee Elementary School, respectively, after the Confederate leaders Stonewall Jackson, Turner Ashby, and Robert E. Lee.<br><br>The two public schools in Shenandoah County, Virginia, changed their names in 2020 in the wake of national outrage over the killing of 46-year-old George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The incident prompted numerous communities to get rid of Confederate iconography, symbolism, and statues.<br><br>“If you vote to restore the name of Stonewall Jackson in 2024, you will be resurrecting an act of 1959 that is forever rooted in massive resistance and Jim Crow segregation,” one individual said at the meeting.<br><br>“Some people in the county feel that the initial name change stripped them of their Democratic processes while advocating for the honoring of an individual that stripped African-Americans of their Democratic rights,” said Hannah Keen, another member of the community.<br><br>“I am a black student, and if the names are restored, I would have to represent a man that fought for my ancestors to be slaves. That makes me feel like I’m disrespecting my ancestors and going against what my family and I believe,” said an eighth-grade student at Stonewall Jackson High School. “I think it is unfair to me that restoring the names is up for discussion.”"}]
