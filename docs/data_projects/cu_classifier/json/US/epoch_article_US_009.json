The artist’s debut solo exhibition showcases an array of sizes and techniques of his works.<br><br>“The Midtown Gallery provides a lot of space to showcase my work, which makes me feel like I’ve been given spiritual freedom, and the spirit of freedom brings diversity and inspiration to a painter, and I have a different concept of art—cement paintings, bulls, owls, and the space in this studio accommodates my artistic expression very well,” the artist said.<br><br>According to gallery owner Jun Hwan Chang, the venue provides a one-of-a-kind location that offers a multicultural destination and hub for people living upstate New York.<br><br>“We want to provide a venue for world-renowned artists from different artistic backgrounds, ”The artistic expression of a painter is unique and different. As a gallery, we want to showcase the diverse life experiences and expressiveness of these painters,” he said.<br><br>“In my opinion, art is like breathing, it is alive, and our paintings are also concerned with breathing.” according to Moon Insoo.<br><br>After his graduation he embarked on a journey to to pursue the elite course of the Korean art scene. Most notable was his consecutive selection for special recognition at the Korea National Art Exhibition. He moved on to win the Kim Se-Choong Sculpture award in 1993.<br><br>Moving on from his initial success, the then-upcoming artist was invited by the French Ministry of Culture to hold a solo exhibition in Paris, which gained him international recognition as a talented artist with a strong potential.<br><br>His 1993 work “Barrier,” saw the artist reach beyond the boundaries of the art world and encompass a wider scope, when it was installed in the outdoor sculpture of the Seoul Arts Center.<br><br>However, the sculpture was received with a mixed response due to its rugged construction style, featuring predominantly steel plates and hefty concrete blocks, which over the course of several decades underwent a process of oxidation and rust, sparking controversy among some Korean art lovers who insist that art should resemble beauty.<br><br>“Barrier” was likened to a sculpture created by American artist Richard Serra in 1981, “Titled Arc,” which stirred a similar controversy and was subsequently rejected for its raw construction style.<br><br>The massive steel sculpture, which measured 120 feet in length and 12 feet in in height, was exhibited at the Foley Federal Plaza in Manhattan, New York. Upon its installation, it evoked protests by residents and commuters, who perceived it to be an eyesore.<br><br>It was ultimately dismantled in 1989 following a petition from more than 1,000 people who worked in nearby buildings, after the artist filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the federal government.<br><br>Gallery Chang, conversely, has taken a different view on the artist’s works and instead likened his creations with other contemporary European artists.<br><br>“While Moon Insoo is often likened to Richard Serra due to similar incidents and material choices, in reality he draws much inspiration from the works of European sculptors such as Anthony Caro and Eduardo Chillida.”<br><br>“Moon Insoo’s, which vividly depict the dynamism and strength of bulls and owls by emphasizing the contrast between black and red, blur the boundaries between painting and sculpture with a unique technique.”<br><br>One part of the exhibition is held at 150 West 55th Street, New York, NY 10019 and will run through June 8. A second part of the exhibition is being held at 55 North St, Middletown NY 10940, and will run through July 7."}]
