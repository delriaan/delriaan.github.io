Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.), Nicholas Langworthy (R-N.Y.), and Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) against Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s Board of Elections.<br><br>The lawmakers joined several other GOP elected officials, voters, and the party’s state and national committees in the original suit seeking to overturn the law on the day it was signed into law by Ms. Hocul last year. A lower court ruled the law was constitutional in February, and Ms. Stefanik appealed the decision.<br><br>The appellants argued that the universal mail-in voting provisions of the act violated the New York Constitution, specifically targeting what they claimed was an improper expansion of absentee voting without a constitutional amendment.<br><br>The appellate court found that the state’s Legislature had the authority to expand voting methods, including mail-in voting, without needing a constitutional amendment.<br><br>This law was introduced to enhance voter participation and streamline the voting process across the state, according to Democrats.<br><br>Key features of the act include a requirement for applications to be received by local Boards of Elections at least ten days before the election, confirmation of voter eligibility, and the provision of postage-paid return envelopes for ballots.<br><br>Under New York state’s constitution, absentee voting is accepted only in the event of illness, being out of the state for a definable reason, or military service overseas.<br><br>Republicans argued that the people of New York voted against expanding absentee voting when the proposed amendment “Authorizing No-Excuse Absentee Ballot Voting” was presented as a ballot initiative in 2021. It was rejected by 55 percent of voters.<br><br>RNC lawyers argued in briefs that allowing unrestricted early voting forces the GOP to spend additional time, money, and manpower to adjust to a new electoral scheme that greatly differs from the past in-person voting model.<br><br>The court’s opinion, written by Justice Michael Lynch, emphasized the historical evolution of absentee voting laws and the legislative authority granted by Article II, Section 7, which allows for voting “by ballot, or by such other method as may be prescribed by law.”<br><br>Justice Lynch’s opinion detailed that the original 1846 constitutional requirement for in-person voting was significantly altered over the years, culminating in the 1966 amendment that removed the explicit in-person voting mandate. This change, the court concluded, empowers the Legislature to prescribe alternative voting methods, including universal mail-in voting.<br><br>“The Legislature has broad plenary power to determine the manner of voting,” the opinion stated, underscoring their ruling that the act’s provisions are in line with the Constitution’s current framework and historical context.<br><br>The ruling has been hailed by proponents of expanded voting access as a significant victory for voter rights and electoral participation.<br><br>Opponents expressed disappointment, arguing that the decision disregards the voters’ previous rejection of a constitutional amendment for no-excuse absentee voting in 2021.<br><br>“On behalf of all New Yorkers concerned with New York Democrats’ illegal and unconstitutional assault on election integrity in New York State, today’s ruling by the Appellate Division is shameful and unconstitutional,” Ms. Stefanik said in light of the ruling Thursday. “The New York State Constitution couldn’t be clearer: If you would like to alter the legal absentee ballot process, it must be decided on by the voters through a constitutional amendment.”<br><br>Ms. Stefanik added: “Voters in New York had this option two years ago and overwhelmingly voted against it. Now New York Democrats are illegally jamming through an unconstitutional law that harms election integrity, all while our Far Left Democrat-run courts go right along with it. Democrats’ political weaponization of the courts must end, and we look forward to appealing this ruling to the highest court in our state, the Court of Appeals.”"}]
