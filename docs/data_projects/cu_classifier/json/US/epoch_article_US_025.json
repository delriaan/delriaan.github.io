Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), himself a Jew, criticized the bill on these grounds.<br><br>At worst, critics fear that these aspects of the IHRA definition could compel schools to take punitive measures against students who express otherwise-protected speech critical of Israel or risk losing federal funding.<br><br>Reps. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) expressed the same concerns in comments to The Epoch Times.<br><br>“My concern is that it violates First Amendment speech,” Mr. Khanna said.<br><br>Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), the bill’s sponsor, dismissed these criticisms, telling The Epoch Times that “Being anti-Zionist is being anti-Semitic.”<br><br>Some conservatives have pointed to a clause in IHRA’s definition of anti-Semitism that describes “claims that Jews killed Jesus” as anti-Semitism.<br><br>Because this claim is stated in the Bible, these conservative critics have expressed concerns that the legislation could be used to target or pull funding from Christian schools.<br><br>This criticism was expressed by Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).<br><br>Tal-Or Cohen Montemayor, founder and CEO of CyberWell, which combats anti-Semitism online, said that the reactions about free speech are “deeply overblown.”<br><br>The bill “protects specifically against being used to violate or infringe upon constitutional rights,” she said, noting a section at the end of the bill which explicitly states that the bill will have no effect on First Amendment rights.<br><br>Arie Lipnick, a board member of Combat Antisemitism Movement, told The Epoch Times the bill would make little change to current law.<br><br>“There’s nothing new under the sun,” he said of the bill, arguing it would have no effect on protected speech.<br><br>A student simply holding a sign stating “Israel has no right to exist,” though considered anti-Semitic under the IHRA definition, would not compel a response from the university or bring any penalties to the student, he said.<br><br>But, he said, if student activists blocked the doors of the school library to keep Jewish students out because they are Jewish—all while holding up anti-Semitic signs—that would constitute an illegal act of discrimination and would compel a response from the university.<br><br>“This governs actions, not words,” he said.<br><br>Kenneth Marcus, who led the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education under President Trump, echoed the sentiment.<br><br>“Most forms of anti-Semitism … do not violate any law whatsoever,” he told The Epoch Times, arguing that speech currently protected under the First Amendment would remain protected.<br><br>Lawmakers, meanwhile, have presented the bill as a necessary response to the ongoing protests rocking college campuses across the United States.<br><br>Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) told The Epoch Times, “I think it’s a great opportunity for us to make sure that we’re speaking out against the anti-Semitism we’re seeing in college campuses across the country.”<br><br>With both Mr. Schumer and the White House tight-lipped on next steps for the bill, it’s uncertain if it will ever become law."}]
