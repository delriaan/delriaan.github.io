To pressure states into compliance with their new rule, the complaint says HSS is threatening to withhold federal funds from states or insurers that refuse to allow or fund these interventions.<br><br>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was also named in the lawsuit.<br><br>The Title IX changes implemented by the Biden administration prohibit sexual discrimination in schools and modify language to include sexual orientation and gender identity for LGBT students.<br><br>Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody’s office said in a press release that the 2024 Rules exceed the limits of Section 1557 and Title IX by requiring Florida to permit and even pay for the drugs and medical procedures for “gender transition.”<br><br>It also requires the Florida Department of Health to immediately suspend the license of any health care practitioner who is arrested for committing or attempting to provide those services.<br><br>The law also bans the use of state funds for “sex-reassignment prescriptions and procedures.”<br><br>The complaint also argues that the effort of HHS to compare therapeutic medical procedures like removing cancerous organs to “removing a healthy organ for a gender transition” is a “false equivalency.”<br><br>Citing numerous reasons why the 2024 Rules are unlawful and harmful to the state, Florida asks the court to vacate the 2024 Rules, to issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining enforcement, and to declare that the 2024 Rules are arbitrary and conflict with law.<br><br>This included rules limiting access to bathrooms, locker rooms, school sports, and health care.<br><br>James Esseks, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBTQ & HIV Project applauded the order in a press release at the time, saying it’s “a relief to have a government that is committed to preventing discrimination as opposed to enabling it.”<br><br>In March 2022, the White House implemented changes to federal identification documents like passports and social security records to allow gender identities outside of biological sex.<br><br>Bonnie Gasper is celebrating Florida’s lawsuit.<br><br>“I’m glad they’re suing the Biden Administration,” she told The Epoch Times, saying it’s important for states to protect children from “body mutilating surgeries and chemical and surgical sterilization.”<br><br>She described the effort of the Biden administration to force gender ideology on the country as “tone deaf,” saying it resolves none of the underlying mental health issues that many gender-confused children are dealing with.<br><br>“Instead, they damage them more by affirming tragic and permanent harms that can’t be undone,” she said.<br><br>Ms. Gasper noted the flood of transgender policies, executive orders, and rules President Biden has pushed since moving into the White House, describing it as an example of the “Cloward-Piven Strategy.”<br><br>The Cloward-Piven Strategy is a political approach designed to create chaos to prompt a political crisis that will lead to legislative changes that achieve a desired objective.<br><br>“It’s meant to overwhelm the system,” she said. “These new transgender policies are a consequence of [former President] Obama’s promise to fundamentally change America.”<br><br>“They’re trying to silence doctors from using their professional judgment with their patients, pushing a one-size-fits-all approach to gender-confused children that’s ‘affirmation only,’ and [saying] you must give them puberty blockers and you must cut off healthy organs and chemically castrate them,” she said further.<br><br>Ms. Gasper noted the growing number of reports being released with “an abundance of evidence” proving that the “affirmation only” approach to treating gender dysphoria is “not based on science, biology, or ethics.”<br><br>It also said, “GD is not a permanent diagnosis” and that the development of gender identity “heavily leans on social processes” like exploration, experimentation, the use of digital platforms, and “external feedback.”<br><br>Such evidence, Ms. Gasper said, proves why lawsuits fighting back against permanent, gender-altering procedures for children are so important.<br><br>“No child will ever have their sex reassigned,” Ms. Gasper insisted. “It’s a lie and they all know it. Every state should follow Florida’s lead and protect its minor children from these barbaric procedures.”<br><br>The Epoch Times reached out to the White House, HHS, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for comment."}]
