But when President Joe Biden took over in 2021, one of his first moves was to halt construction on the project.<br><br>Jim Chilton, a rancher from Arivaca, said that decision had left a half-mile gap in the wall along his property, over which thousands of illegal immigrants have traipsed on their way to a nearby migrant camp.<br><br>“I have images now of over 3,050 people coming through the ranch marching north,” Mr. Chilton said. “Are any of these 3,050 terrorists? This is a national security issue.”<br><br>Jacob Kartchner, a retired Cochise County sheriff’s deputy, said roughly 90 percent of the illegal immigrants he’d encountered throughout his career were “military-aged males” between the ages of 18 and 40. He added that the flow of such individuals into the county had increased “over tenfold” since 2021.<br><br>Meanwhile, cross-border human smuggling has led to several fatal car accidents from high-speed chases in the area.<br><br>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency identifies fentanyl as the “deadliest drug threat” the nation has ever faced, killing more than 38,000 Americans in the first half of 2023 alone.<br><br>For some, that number may just be a statistic. For Jill Fagan Alexander, it’s the reason she now has two fewer children.<br><br>Recounting her sons’ tragic deaths before the committee, Mrs. Alexander choked back tears.<br><br>She noted that her 20-year-old son, Sam, had struggled with drug addiction but wanted to straighten out his life. His efforts fell apart, however, when he relapsed and realized how easy it was to obtain a cheap and potent high from fentanyl. He was arrested last year while high and battling COVID-19. And somewhere between the combined symptoms of his sickness and withdrawal, he chose to end his life.<br><br>As if that loss weren’t painful enough, Mrs. Alexander was forced to relive that agony again when her 13-year-old son, Gabe, was found unresponsive. He had complained earlier that day of feeling unwell, and she later learned that he’d taken a pill he found at his older brother’s apartment when they went to clean it out.<br><br>“I think after he showered and said he was going to take a nap he thought he was out of the woods,” she said. “I think he thought he was going to wake up that day, but he never woke up again.”<br><br>Mrs. Alexander acknowledged that her sons’ decisions had played a role in their own fates. “But this virtual flood of pills both into and through Arizona, which has dramatically worsened under the current administration, allowed my boys to make choices they may not have without the current open-border crisis,” she said.<br><br>Mrs. Alexander now focuses on educating others about the signs and dangers of fentanyl poisoning and what parents can do to protect their children. Most of the nation’s illicit fentanyl, she noted, is entering the country through Arizona.<br><br>Asked what she thought would help with those efforts, she said the first step should be closing the border to stop the flow of drugs and other illicit items into the country.<br><br>She added that she thought the penalties for producing, transporting, and selling lethal drugs needed to be tougher.<br><br>“I’m not going to mince words. I think it’s treasonous,” Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) said, accusing President Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of betraying the American people.<br><br>The witnesses before the committee, however, did not seem to find them so far-fetched.<br><br>A couple of them said they believed the president was allowing the situation to create more Democrat voters. Mrs. Alexander, however, said she thought there was more to his decision-making.<br><br>“I think it is also genuinely a dislike for who we are as America,” she said.<br><br>“I don’t think that he likes who we are. I don’t think he wants us to continue having freedoms that we do. I think by allowing whoever and whatever to come over the border, it changes, it shifts, and I don’t think he’s opposed to that. And that’s very sad, because I love America.”"}]
