If Democrats can tightly control the narrative, it makes it easy to influence how people will think and vote.”<br><br>A perfect example, Mr. Riddaugh noted, was how the Biden administration controlled the topic of COVID-19.<br><br>In 2021, Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) had their YouTube accounts suspended for violating the platforms’ COVID-19 policy. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) had her Facebook account suspended for the same reason, and after multiple suspensions of her Twitter account for violating the platform’s COVID-19 policies, her account was permanently shut down on Jan. 2, 2022.<br><br>As we move closer to the Nov. 5 general election, Mr. Riddaugh suggests tech companies will use a variety of tactics to control the narrative.<br><br>“They will deplatform candidates, organizations, and businesses for their political positions,” he proposed. “If there’s a news article they don’t agree with, like the New York Post Hunter laptop story, they will suppress it.”<br><br>“Going into 2024 there will be a lot of traps Big Tech companies will set to suppress conservative voices,” he said further. “You saw Democrats working directly with these tech companies to suppress the message of their opposition in 2020. That alone is a massive threat to free and fair elections and trust in the system.”<br><br>“The writing is on the wall,” he said. “The Biden administration would not be fighting so hard in the courts to retain their right to coordinate with Silicon Valley if they didn’t believe it helped their cause. That alone is a massive threat to free and fair election and the trust in the system.”<br><br>“If you don’t allow Americans to consume both sides of the story and to come to their own conclusions, that’s dangerous,” he proposed. “Look at Russia and China. One of the things they have in common is they control the narrative. It’s a one-sided debate. It’s eerie to see it happening here.”"}]
