The Epoch Times contacted the court for comment.<br><br>But Tim Fitton, the head of the Judicial Watch legal group, wrote that complaints about Judge Cannon’s decisions are unwarranted, arguing that such a timeline “is normal and not surprising.”<br><br>“There are some boxes where the order of items within that box is not the same as in the associated scans,” Mr. Smith’s team wrote, adding that the update contrasts with what they told the judge several weeks ago during a hearing.<br><br>The boxes in question have “items smaller than standard paper such as index cards, books, and stationary, which shift easily when the boxes are carried, especially because many of the boxes are not full,” they added.<br><br>After the disclosure, President Trump wrote his Truth Social platform that he believes Mr. Smith should be arrested before calling for the case to be immediately dropped.<br><br>In the meantime, there has been speculation that the classified documents case will not go to trial before the 2024 election. If it does, it would likely be in the weeks immediately before Nov. 5, an outcome sure to draw accusations of election interference from President Trump’s legal team.<br><br>“Any judge would take pause with the idea of trying a presidential candidate a month before the presidential election,” said attorney Kel McClanahan, who specializes in national security issues and has represented members of the intelligence community.<br><br>A Trump win in November could mean that neither case ever reaches a jury. As president, President Trump could direct the Department of Justice to drop the federal charges or seek to pardon himself.<br><br>The charges in the Florida case include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the unauthorized possession of national defense information, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to investigators.<br><br>President Trump has pleaded not guilty to 40 charges connected to allegations that he illegally retained classified documents at his home after leaving in January 2021 and obstructed officials’ attempts to retrieve them. Two of his aides, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, have also been charged in the case.<br><br>He also faces charges in New York, where a trial is currently ongoing in which he is accused of falsifying business records during the 2016 election. Election interference charges were also filed in Fulton County, Georgia, and Washington.<br><br>He’s pleaded not guilty to those charges, too, arguing they’re part of an orchestrated plot to imperil his 2024 reelection chances."}]
