This was a horrible mistake.”<br><br>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) called the Biden White House “the most anti-Israel administration this nation has ever seen.” He claimed the Biden administration has been undermining Israel right from the beginning of the conflict.<br><br>“When Oct. 7 happened, when Hamas death squads were murdering 1,200 innocent civilians, were raping women and little girls, while the attacks were happening, the Biden State Department sent out a tweet at three in the morning saying Israel must not retaliate, there should be no military response. That tweet was disgraceful. I called it out at three in the morning and they deleted the tweet within minutes,” he said.<br><br>The next day, U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken posted another tweet, saying he talked to the Turkish foreign minister and they both agreed that Israel should not retaliate against Hamas’s violence, the senator stated. “I called that tweet out again. They deleted it again,”<br><br>“Where are we today? Well yesterday, Joe Biden said, ‘I made it clear if Israel goes into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons. We’re not going to supply the weapons and the artillery shells.’ I will point out Joe Biden and the Democrats lied to the American people on the supplemental funding bill that was just voted.”<br><br>She clarified this was a “pause” and that there was no “stopping of weaponry.” The press secretary insisted that the Biden administration’s “commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad.”<br><br>The weapons shipment had included 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs.<br><br>“We are especially focused on the end use of the 2000-pound bombs and the impact they could have in dense urban settings, as we have seen in other parts of Gaza,” Ms. Jean-Pierre said.<br><br>The administration has not made a final determination as to how to proceed with the shipment.<br><br>During the May 8 Senate hearing in which Mr. Austin took part, Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) condemned the decision to delay weapons delivery to Israel.<br><br>Such a delay was “disastrous,” he said, comparing Israel’s use of large bombs in populated areas to America’s use of nuclear weapons in Japan during World War II, insisting that both are justified.<br><br>“This is obscene. It is absurd. Give Israel what they need to fight the war they can’t afford to lose,” Mr. Graham said.<br><br>“Hamas murdered thousands of innocent civilians, including babies, and are still holding Americans hostage, if the hostages are still alive. Yet Crooked Joe is taking the side of these terrorists, just like he has sided with the Radical Mobs taking over our college campuses, because his donors are funding them,” he wrote.<br><br>“Biden is weak, corrupt, and leading the world straight into World War III. Remember—this war in Israel, just like the war in Ukraine, would have NEVER started if I was in the White House.”"}]
