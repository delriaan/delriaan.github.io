James Comer (R-Ky.) told NBC that President Trump “needs better judgment in who he dines with,“ adding, “I would not take a meeting with that person,” referring to Mr. Fuentes. “I wouldn’t take a meeting with Kanye West, either.”<br><br>President Trump later told Fox News that he had “no idea” what Mr. Fuentes’s views were and that those views “weren’t expressed at the table in our very quick dinner, or it wouldn’t have been accepted.”"}]
