Angie Craig (D-Minn.), joined by other 14 House Democrats, asked the president to take executive action on the border.<br><br>The letter comes as anxiety about the border remains a top concern for voters, topping opinion poll after opinion poll of the issues that voters most care about.<br><br>“All of our constituents, no matter our congressional district, have felt the impacts of the current border situation,” the Democrats wrote. “Communities across the country are grappling with the fentanyl crisis and struggling to find appropriate shelter and services for those seeking asylum.”<br><br>The 15 Democrats said that such action is necessary because of the failure of an earlier attempt by the Senate to negotiate an immigration deal, which they blamed on Republicans.<br><br>That deal would have seen Republicans offer the passage of Ukraine aid and other national security items requested by the president in exchange for border policy changes and funding. However, the deal was rejected by Republicans, who noted that, under its terms, as many as 5,000 illegal aliens could have been permitted to enter the country every day.<br><br>Democrats, for their part, have attempted to portray Republicans’ rejection of the package as a political stunt designed to enhance former President Donald Trump’s reelection bid by keeping the immigration issue alive.<br><br>“Our House colleagues would rather see the crisis continue and use it as a campaign ad instead of actually addressing this national security issue,” the Democrats wrote, specifically placing the blame with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).<br><br>Republicans have retorted that President Biden doesn’t need a new law to secure the border, and has more than enough existing authority to do so if he wished.<br><br>Until now, most Democrats have rejected this argument.<br><br>But with immigration angst posing a serious concern for Democrats’ reelection aspirations, a handful of moderate Democrats now seem to be opening up to the option.<br><br>“We recognize that ultimately fixing our broken immigration system is complex and requires Congress to act, but while Republicans continue to refuse to come to the table and intentionally destroy bipartisan solutions, we still must act to protect our country,” they wrote.<br><br>“It has become clear that the current situation remains untenable, but with Republicans playing politics on border security, it is time for your administration to act.<br><br>“We urge you to use all tools at your disposal, including executive action, to better address security at the Southern border, interdict illicit fentanyl and allow for orderly legal immigration.”<br><br>However, these changes have been condemned by some as insufficient to deal with the massive influx of illegal aliens.<br><br>Aside from Ms. Craig, the 14 other Democrat signatories of the letter were Reps. Mike Levin (D-Calif.), Shanice Davids (D-Kan.), Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.), Chris Pappas (D-N.H.), Susie Lee (D-Nev.), Steven Horsford (D-Nev.), Pat Ryan (D-N.Y.), Susan Wild (D-Pa.), Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.), Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), and Val Hoyle (D-Ore.)."}]
