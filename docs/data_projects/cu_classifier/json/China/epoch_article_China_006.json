Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), co-sponsor of the bill, noted that “U.S. supply chains must break free from our dependency on foreign adversaries–American patients cannot be in a position where we rely on China for genomic testing or basic pharmaceutical ingredients.”<br><br>In a press release, the House Select Committee on the CCP, chaired by Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), expressed concerns about the Chinese regime’s national security laws that require all Chinese firms—including biotech firms that collect, test, and store American genomic data—to share requested information with Beijing.<br><br>The legislation singles out several top Chinese biotech firms, including genetics company Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI Group), MGI, Complete Genomics, WuXi AppTec, and WuXi Biologics.<br><br>Among those companies, the lawmakers raised concerns that BGI Group and WuXi AppTec could threaten U.S. national security.<br><br>The committee alleged that the WuXi AppTec had received investment from numerous PLA funds, including the AVIC Military-Civil Integration Selected Hybrid Securities Investment Fund.<br><br>“The actions of these entities concerning the collection and analysis of genetic data present a significant risk of diversion to China’s military programs,” it said.<br><br>In 2020, the department also added two BGI subsidiaries—Xinjiang Silk Road BGI and Beijing Liuhe BGI—to its entity list. This decision came after the firms were accused of engaging in human rights violations against Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in China’s Xinjiang region.<br><br>Mr. Comer also warned that as the Chinese military becomes more entrenched in the biotechnology industry, “it becomes increasingly clear that the CCP seeks to weaponize genomic and medical data.”<br><br>The Epoch Times has reached out to BGI Group and WuXi AppTec for comments but has not received a response as of press time."}]
