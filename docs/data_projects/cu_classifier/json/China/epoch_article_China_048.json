Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is calling on President Joe Biden to fill a vacancy on his National Security Council—a move that would demonstrate U.S. commitment to human rights around the world.<br><br>Mr. Rubio argued that the vacancy is “impeding the White House’s ability to effectively incorporate international religious freedom concerns within whole-of-government strategies and policies.”<br><br>Additionally, the senator said that filling the position would “enhance our national security by helping to address one of the main causes of conflict and instability.”<br><br>“This individual would play a pivotal role in coordinating efforts across agencies, including with the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, in advising you and your administration on matters related to religious freedom, and contributing to the development of policies that reflect the values of our great nation,” Mr. Rubio said.<br><br>“Forced organ harvesting is an atrocity and the disruption and deterrence of this practice should be a priority of the State Department,” the letter reads.<br><br>“Given the global demand for organ transplants and the evidence of the illegal trafficking of organs in the PRC [People’s Republic of China], there is a pressing need to uncover first-hand information from those who witnessed or engaged in the practice.”<br><br>On May 7, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller was asked during a news briefing whether the department would consider the Congressional-Executive Commission on China’s request.<br><br>The CCP leadership, fearing that the practice’s popularity threatened the regime’s absolute control, launched a brutal campaign to eradicate the group in July 1999. Since then, millions of practitioners have been illegally detained in prisons, labor camps, and other facilities, with hundreds of thousands tortured while incarcerated, according to the Falun Dafa Information Center.<br><br>“Beijing and Moscow have, for years, undermined religious freedom as they actively target anyone who is simply trying to live out their faith,” Mr. Rubio told The Epoch Times."}]
