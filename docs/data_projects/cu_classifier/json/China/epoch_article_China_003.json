Año said in a Friday statement that he was joining Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, Commodore Jay Tarriela, in calling for “appropriate actions against individuals in the Chinese Embassy” who they accuse of leaking “spurious transcripts or recordings of purported conversations” between Filipino officials—specifically between a Chinese diplomat and allegedly the head of the Armed Forces of the Philippines–Western Command (AFP-WESCOM).<br><br>The Chinese officials released to local media what the Filipino adviser said were “spurious transcripts or recordings of purported conversations between officials of the host country.”<br><br>According to the Chinese-released recordings, the full context of which are not fully clear, the officials discussed some kind of “gentleman’s agreement” regarding the Philippines’ routine resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal—also known as the Second Thomas Shoal and Rén'ài Jiāo by China.<br><br>The Second Thomas Shoal has become a highly contested point in China’s aggressive push to claim ownership of areas within its nine-dash line in South China Sea. Chinese Coast Guard vessels have for many months been carrying out water cannon attacks on Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessels attempting to reach the shoal to resupply an outpost. China’s actions have left Filipino officers injured.<br><br>“I am issuing this statement to generate awareness on this clear attempt by China to advance another falsehood in order to divide our people and distract us from their unlawful presence and actions in our EEZ [exclusive economic zone].<br><br>“We advise our citizens, the media, and the international community to beware of China’s methods of manipulations, interference, and malign influence in furthering its own interests,” the defense minister said.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr. Año said in his statement that no one in the Philippines government, except for the president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has the power to enter into such an agreement with a foreign power.<br><br>The Philippines’ foreign ministry also responded to the content of the Chinese-released recordings, saying it “reiterates its firm position that the Philippines has not entered into any agreement abandoning its sovereign rights and jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, including on the Ayungin Shoal.”<br><br>The CCP’s claims have been met with pushback by China’s neighbors in the region who have overlapping claims in waters within their EEZ as recognized by standing international law to which China is a signatory.<br><br>Mr. Marcos Jr. has insisted on his country’s sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea region of the South China Sea, and has criticized the continuous presence of Chinese vessels in these waters.<br><br>China claims sovereignty over much of the South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Japan, and Taiwan.<br><br>Mr. Tarriela on Saturday also pointed to the presence of the Chinese Maritime Militia near Escoda Shoal, also known as Sabina Shoal, which is within the Philippines’ EEZ—just 75 nautical miles from the coast of Palawan.<br><br>The PCG has, over the past month, been deployed to Escoda Shoal to monitor the CCP’s activities in the area.<br><br>On Friday, the PCG reported that crushed corals have been imported and dumped near Escoda Shoal, which Filipino marine biologists described as like island-building activity in the West Philippine Sea.<br><br>Differences in color between the local sand and dumped coral was evident in the video."}]
