The letter alleged that semiconductors were produced in Tianjin University’s lab operated jointly with the Chinese military.<br><br>The United States and China, amid an intense geopolitical and scientific rivalry, both view semiconductors as a strategic industry with civilian and military uses, including quantum computing and advanced weapons systems.<br><br>A spokesperson from Georgia Tech said that it welcomed the congressional inquiry but that Georgia Tech Research Institute “does not have a collaboration, research partnerships, or provide any funding to Tianjin University.”<br><br>In addition, the lawmakers also questioned the $250 million allocation from the Shenzhen local government to build the Georgia Tech Shenzhen Institute campus in China.<br><br>The lawmakers then asked Georgia Tech to provide information related to its involvement with Chinese entities, including funding, collaborations, and research partnerships.<br><br>“We cannot let the CCP crush the academic freedom that has blessed our country and blessed us with great institutions like the place that I am standing [within] today,” he said. “We need help of students. We need help of faculty. We need help of administrations all across America. We need trustees to police their endowments and the deals their universities are striking with the CCP and CCP-backed groups.”<br><br>The increased vigilance against technology theft by the CCP targeting foreign researchers is linked to a 2020 Trump administration rule that banned graduate students with ties to the Chinese regime’s military-civil fusion strategy."}]
