Gen. Deng Zhiping, who was taken away by the disciplinary committee of the military commission at the station when he came back from a meeting in Nanjing. Also arrested on the same day were Major General He Yuehua, deputy political commissar of the Eastern Theater Naval Forces, and Major General Deng Hongqin, commander of the Xichang Satellite Launch Base of the Rocket Force.<br><br>Mr. Yao told The Epoch Times on April 19 that the news he acquired from a former colleague in the army is reliable.<br><br>According to Mr. Yao, Party leader  Xi Jinping would not stop arresting army officials, causing the number of fallen officials to increase as “once one military head is removed from the top, many others will be implicated.”<br><br>The Epoch Times could not independently verify the video.<br><br>Mr. Chen believes this is a step forward in Xi’s efforts to consolidate his military power. He may strengthen a military that is “loyal only to the Party,” with the ultimate goal of being loyal to the Party’s supreme leader, that is, to become his army alone. “Like North Korea. North Korea’s slogan is to defend the Kim regime, and Kim Jong-un and Xi will probably fly along this path, which is only being explored now.”<br><br>On the other hand, Mr. Chen surmised that Xi had no confidence in the army’s control. His continued crackdown on the military is a stopgap measure, and disloyalty and corruption will last until the end of the CCP.<br><br>“Unless there is a political system reform, however, which is almost impossible for the dictatorial communist rulers.”"}]
