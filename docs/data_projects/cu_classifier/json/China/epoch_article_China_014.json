There are only a few countries in Europe that are economically weak [that] need the economic exchanges with China.”<br><br>Mr. Wang, an assistant researcher at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taiwan, told The Epoch Times: “The overall picture of Europe and the United States is probably very clear, that is, from the original unilateral confrontation between the United States and China, it is now slowly expanding to the EU and Japan to jointly counter [the CCP’s] economic coercion, from traditional tariff wars to technology ban, and now rising to the level of economic security.”"}]
