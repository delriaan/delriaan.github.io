They dodged any diagnosis of potential COVID-19 variants while uniformly treating cases as “influenza.”<br><br>Over a couple of years, since Chinese Communist Party (CCP) authorities lifted a stringent anti-virus policy and city lockdowns at the end of 2022, the pandemic seems to have disappeared from Chinese people’s daily lives as COVID-related news has almost been unseen in the official media or on censored social media platforms.<br><br>However, strict prevention measures are still in place at high-level official venues, and nucleic acid tests are usually performed on visiting foreign guests and accompanying journalists.<br><br>The doctor was convinced that “the virus has evolved even more deadly.” As he saw, many patients were infected with COVID-19 mutations or had after-effects or complications, with dire health conditions. Some symptoms emerged very rapidly, like vomiting and diarrhea overnight and then dying the following day.<br><br>He told the reporter that he knew about a sudden death case of his colleague’s wife, who was infected in the hospital when she came to get some saline injections for a cold. “When she returned home [that day], she immediately developed symptoms, and her coughing reaction was particularly strong. When my colleague went back, she said to him, ‘I’ll make you a meal,’ but before the meal was finished, she suddenly fainted on the floor and could not be resuscitated.”<br><br>Deaths are increasing, as evidenced by many Chinese netizens who found more graves when they returned to their hometowns for the Tomb-sweeping Festival, a Chinese traditional festival in the first week of April. One netizen exposed that his neighboring village has a mortality rate of about 3 percent, more than fourfold the average.<br><br>Simultaneously, the price of the cemetery plot has increased as the demand has increased. In first- and second-tier cities, a cemetery plot has a whopping price ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 yuan ($14,000–$27,000), with other limits such as only 20 years of term of use and charges for annual cemetery management fees.<br><br>This has promoted a boom in cremation houses, according to Mr. Li. More citizens resort to third- or fourth-tier cities and spend about 200,000 yuan ($27,000) on buying a place for the ashes of their loved ones.<br><br>So, the core issue is how much the health of the Chinese people has been devastated over the past few years, Mr. Lin said in Pinnacle View.<br><br>In particular, as per Mr. Lin, the immunity of Chinese youth is now much weaker, so the proportion of young people dying in this wave of respiratory disease has also increased, which is a big problem.<br><br>Moreover, the elderly who already have underlying diseases would add to the death toll.<br><br>On the other hand, Mr. Lin pointed out that “in the field of public health, a pandemic cannot be examined solely from the disease itself. From the perspective of the state of society as a whole, the mentality of the people, and the whole state of cognition, I think all these factors impacted how pandemics spread across the country.”<br><br>Mr. Lin recalled plagues in human history; for example, the influenza outbreak in Spain in 1918 coincided with the tremendous social change in the First World War. When the Black Death of A.D. 541 occurred in Europe, it also met with the collapse of the Roman Empire, which was entirely corrupt at the end of its rule.<br><br>Ms. Guo said in Pinnacle View that the epidemic is worsening in China, although the CCP obscures the truth, and there is no coverage in the official media. Nevertheless, everyone knew that countless Chinese people have died so far in this epidemic that has lasted for years, and the tragedy persists.<br><br>According to Ms. Guo, a majority of the senior CCP officials and prominent figures who died this year were CCP members, and many of them had committed crimes in the campaign to suppress Falun Gong.<br><br>“Some people may not be religious or maybe materialists, whatever you believe, but a person’s health is indeed closely related to their mental condition. Psychology has summarized and created charts based on the effects of human emotions on health. The unhealthiest emotions are envy, resentment, anger, and suspicion; the healthiest are cheerfulness, tolerance, and kindness,” she said.<br><br>“In terms of basic emotions, the whole theory of communism and socialism was surrounded by envy and resentment, which seriously jeopardized the mental health of human beings. It is well known that a person’s mental state can seriously affect his or her health, especially when viruses are ravaging the human race. Medically speaking, it leads to a decline in overall immunity.”<br><br>“It demonstrates the Chinese tend to fall into a particularly hostile or hateful mood, which traditional Chinese medicine defines as a form of dampness, an evil in the body that damages health.<br><br>The prophecy foretells plagues and other major disasters, like this COVID-19 outbreak, according to Mr. Li. It implied, for example, that the epidemic began in the winter of 2019 and would be more dangerous to those who hold power and wealth in their hands; this disease is targeting people who stand with the CCP.<br><br>Mr. Li said this ancient sage even predicted the end time of the epidemic; everyone would find it hard to live through the Year of the Dragon (2024) and the Year of the Snake (2025), and only after these two years passed could it disappear."}]
