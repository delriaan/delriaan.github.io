The threats were temporarily halted by border police a few minutes later.<br><br>This agricultural technician from Guangdong Province traveled to Europe in the spring of 2023. In September 2023, he went to France after being threatened in Germany.<br><br>Mr. Ling stated that he was located by the Chinese Embassy. After arriving in Paris, he was repeatedly followed, assaulted, and humiliated by Chinese individuals on the streets, who even took photos and sent them to his family in China to pressure him.<br><br>On March 22, Mr. Ling received a call from the Chinese embassy, asking him to meet for a conversation outside a Chinese restaurant in Aubervilliers, a northern suburb of Paris. The address had long been identified by French intelligence as an underground Chinese police station.<br><br>“They said they had people everywhere in France and would find me no matter what. I felt I would be arrested and deported back to China,” he told media later.<br><br>After the conversation, Mr. Ling was taken directly to Charles de Gaulle Airport by two cars, with France 2’s filming team and Challenges’ reporters following. He later explained that he was promised his passport back once he got into the car.<br><br>Upon entering the airport, he was surrounded by two Chinese embassy staff and staff from a local Chinese organization wearing red vests. His phone and identity documents were held by embassy officials. A suited individual accompanied him to board, but just before boarding, Mr. Ling made up his mind to escape, angering the embassy staff who chased after him.<br><br>Reporters from Challenges and France 2 intervened to protect and assist Mr. Ling in reclaiming his passport.

Henri Thulliez, Mr. Ling’s lawyer, said that the case was typical and clear, that it was “unacceptable that foreign authorities could jeopardize the fundamental rights of a citizen on French territory.”"}]
