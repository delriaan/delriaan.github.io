It warned that China may also face challenges in meeting its target of increasing the proportion of non-fossil fuels to 20 percent of the overall energy mix by the same year.<br><br>“Although China is a growing economy, the huge coal capacity is remarkable, and a concern because of the fact that coal power plants are running at low capacity,” Ms. Garg told The Epoch Times.<br><br>“China’s current pace of infrastructure addition does not justify its coal capacity addition, and we do not understand why China is not focussing on utilizing the existing power plants at full capacity.”<br><br>She added that China hasn’t clearly stated whether some newer capacity would replace older inefficient plants.<br><br>According to CREA, the rigid and antiquated method of operating the grid is the root cause of the shortages. There is now an oversupply of coal-fired power capacity in some grid regions, although 60 percent of new coal power projects are located there. For instance, in Shandong and Guizhou provinces, where there is currently a lot of unused capacity, more coal power plants are being built.<br><br>By 2025, China aims to have significantly decreased its energy and carbon intensity and severely limit the expansion of its coal use, according to its 2021 revised Nationally Determined Commitment under the Paris Agreement. An additional objective of the country’s five-year plans is to source more than half of the growth in energy consumption from renewable sources by 2025 and to raise the proportion of non-fossil fuels in the energy mix to 20 percent.<br><br>But after 2023, none of these goals will be achieved, says CREA.<br><br>China’s GDP growth decreased during and after the zero-COVID years (2020–2023), although CO2 emissions soared. During this period, the service sector, which uses less energy, was in a tailspin while the carbon-intensive industries drove economic expansion. According to CREA’s study of preliminary government statistics on energy use in 2023, there was a 5.2 percent rise in CO2 emissions from the energy industry.<br><br>The process of decarbonization is intricate and lengthy, says Xuyang Dong, China Energy Policy Analyst at Climate Energy Finance. It needs a determined and ambitious workforce, a government and business policy effort supported by solid research, and, most importantly, a considerable commitment of resources.<br><br>Effectively guiding the whole economy towards an inevitable zero-carbon future also necessitates long-term strategic planning, looking forward to market patterns over the next 10 or 20 years.<br><br>“Achieving decarbonization requires more than just an eye to short-term financial gain; fundamental structural reform within the country’s economy is the precondition to thrive from decarbonization both environmentally and economically,” she wrote in a note."}]
