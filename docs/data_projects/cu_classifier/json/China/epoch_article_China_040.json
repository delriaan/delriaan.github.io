The advocates say that after diagnosis, there are no protections to deal with rehabilitation, study, employment, and pension.<br><br>They are calling for the establishment of a “Vaccine Injury Protection Law” to ensure protections in suspected cases and also for scientific impartiality in investigation, diagnosis, and identification and to clarify a series of lifelong survival policies for confirmed cases.<br><br>Hua Xiuzhen, who drafted the proposal, says her daughter’s health was affected by a vaccine. Tan Hua was bitten by a dog in Shanghai in 2014 and became disabled after being vaccinated with a human diploid rabies vaccine produced by Chengdu Kanghua Biological Products Co. Ltd. However, a doctor hid that the vaccine was still being studied at the time.<br><br>Ms. Tan, who suffers from serious conditions such as incurable demyelinating encephalopathy, systemic allergic rash, epilepsy, hearing loss, brain atrophy, and ischemic lesions in her brain’s white matter, lost her job as a result of the illnesses.<br><br>Because of the long-term illnesses and the brutal oppression that Ms. Tan was subjected to for seeking aid from the CCP local government, she also suffers from a mental disorder and relies year-round on imported drugs, Ms. Hua told The Epoch Times. There is no specific drug for the ischemic lesions, and that condition is worsening.<br><br>In 2021, Mr. Qian, who lives in the Chaoyang district of Beijing, accepted a China-made Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine. He said about a week after he received his third dose of the vaccine in October 2021, his body suddenly became paralyzed. At its most severe, he’s unable to move the right half of his body. His partial paralysis caused him to lose his job, leaving him to depend on his wife’s salary f0r his living and medical expenses.<br><br>Although Mr. Qian filed complaints to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Bureau of Letters and Calls, and the government hotline, various governmental departments have avoided taking responsibility. He recalled that when he signed a consent form before receiving the vaccine, the form didn’t list the possible consequences of vaccination.<br><br>This isn’t the first time that a group of Chinese vaccine victims has called for the protection of their rights.<br><br>In May 2022, the victims of Chinese COVID-19 vaccines warned the public about the serious side effects of domestically produced vaccines in an open letter they posted online. The open letter asked the state to acknowledge the side effects and for Sinovac to provide humanitarian aid funds.<br><br>The open letter was written by Mr. Qian and Ms. Tan, along with the parents of some COVID-19 vaccine victims, including Yu Tongan from the city of Jiangmen in Guangdong, Jia Xiaoyu from the city of Baoding, Hebei, and Liang Xiaoqiang from Jiangxi.<br><br>On Dec. 1, 2022, 10 rights protection representatives of vaccine victims brought a list of 1,290 patients with leukemia allegedly triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine to the CCP’s National Health Commission to seek justice.<br><br>They were suppressed, with nine people being detained on criminal charges.<br><br>Among them, Mr. Qian was criminally detained by authorities for one month on suspicion of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”; and Wang Hongyi, who was accused of “communicating with outsiders (overseas),” was arrested. Liang Xiaoqiang, mother of Jiangxi vaccine victim Luo Zhehan, was sent back to her hometown for detention on the grounds of “organizing rights protection.” Wang Kairui, the parent of a COVID-19 vaccine victim in the city of Wuwei, Gansu Province, was sentenced to three years in prison for seeking an investigation and help for his child."}]
