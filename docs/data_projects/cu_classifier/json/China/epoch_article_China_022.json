Two of the co-authors, Jude Blanchette and Scott Kennedy, visited Hong Kong in September 2023. Over nine days, they conducted 35 interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, including authority representatives, former Hong Kong officials, LegCo members, executives from local and multinational companies and financial institutions, university professors, local and international journalists, NGO leaders, and public interest legal experts.<br><br>The report first emphasized Hong Kong’s importance to the United States by listing relevant data.<br><br>The former British colony is the 15th-largest export market for the United States and a top destination for American consumer products. As of 2023, approximately 1,300 American companies were based in Hong Kong, with banks, law firms, accounting firms, and other financial services the most prominent among this group. Additionally, roughly 84,000 Americans live in Hong Kong, while about 250,000 Hong Kong-born immigrants live in the United States.<br><br>“Hong Kong is not yet like a regular city in mainland China, but the trajectory is clear and worrying,” reads the summary. “Areas of resilience remain, but in ways that look largely unsustainable, for example, coming down to the impressively brave behavior of discrete individuals, such as university administrators fighting off curriculum changes.”<br><br>The second option entails the gradual revocation of Hong Kong’s special status under American law, treating the territory as an integral part of China. This approach has already been showcased under the Trump administration’s decertification of Hong Kong’s special status in 2020. U.S. Customs and Border Protection required all goods imported from the city to use the label “Made in China,” rather than “Made in Hong Kong.”<br><br>While the approach may signal a firm stance against Beijing’s encroachments, it risks “accelerating Hong Kong’s loss of autonomy in every dimension.”<br><br>“Beijing will likely conclude it has no choice (or even see this as an opportunity) but to install the CCP more rapidly and make other changes to Hong Kong’s political economy (including eliminating the Hong Kong dollar, for example).”<br><br>The third option advocates for strategic engagement, leveraging diplomatic and economic ties to preserve Hong Kong’s unique identity and remaining freedoms. By maintaining pragmatic interactions with the territory, the United States aims to provide a lifeline for Hong Kongers seeking to uphold their way of life amidst growing authoritarianism.<br><br>“This approach, even while creating immigration and asylum pathways for Hong Kong residents wishing to leave, recognizes that the vast majority will stay in the city—and it is important to support their freedoms. It also recognizes the value that people from all sides in Hong Kong place on a strong and unique relationship with the United States.”<br><br>In conclusion, the CSIS report underscores the urgency for the United States to adopt a nuanced and multifaceted approach toward Hong Kong. As the international community grapples with the escalating crisis in Hong Kong, the stakes have never been higher in preserving the city’s autonomy and safeguarding the aspirations of its people.<br><br>A policy built entirely around punishments or giving up on Hong Kong would be counterproductive and result in the further undermining of whatever autonomy remains, the authors concluded.<br><br>“Spots of resilience persist, and the best policy approach to managing the challenge of Hong Kong will be rooted in a strong understanding of how its citizens, government authorities, businesses, and civil society organizations envision their city’s future,” reads the report.<br><br>“Washington would be wise to focus on sustaining what space remains for civic engagement, foreign interaction, and political debate. Such an approach will require patience and persistence, but it lies firmly within U.S. interests.”"}]
