Chris Smith (R-N.J.), the chair, and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the ranking member of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC)—requested that Mr. Blinken use the State Department’s rewards programs to obtain firsthand evidence to hold those responsible for Beijing’s forced organ harvesting accountable.<br><br>Despite the “impressive amount of testimony amassed” by the independent tribunal, the group of lawmakers said, “there has been no effort to seek evidence on individuals complicit in forced organ harvesting or the organ trafficking industry” by using rewards programs at the State Department.<br><br>Other bounty programs at the department include the long-running Rewards for Justice, which aims to gather information that “protects American lives and furthers U.S. national security objectives,” and the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program, which covers transnational crimes such as human trafficking.<br><br>The lawmakers urged Mr. Blinken to fully utilize the resources available to gather evidence and prioritize addressing the regime’s forced organ harvesting.<br><br>The group wrote that “there is a pressing need to uncover first-hand information from those who witnessed or engaged in the practice,” given the “global demand for organ transplants and the evidence of the illegal trafficking of organs” in communist China.<br><br>“Getting the PRC to account and fully address evidence of forced organ harvesting will be critical in ending this horrific practice and promoting, long term, the establishment of a truly voluntary organ donation system,” the lawmakers wrote, using the acronym of China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China.<br><br>Besides Mr. Smith and Mr. Rubio, others who signed the letter include Reps. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.), Michelle Steel (R-Calif.), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), and Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), all sitting members of the CECC, a bipartisan panel that advises the executive branch and Congress about human rights and the rule of law in China.<br><br>During a CECC hearing in March, Mr. Smith described the industrial-scale forced organ harvesting in China as “an atrocity unmatched in its wickedness.”"}]
