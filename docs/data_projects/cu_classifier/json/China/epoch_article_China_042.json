The CCP’s revival of such a Cultural Revolution term comes amid China’s economic downturn.<br><br>“I believe that when the CCP recently raised the issue of ‘political swindlers,’ they were certainly not referring to ordinary [Party] officials,” she said. “At the very least, they were targeting officials at the level of the Politburo Standing Committee, if not those who ranked second or third in the Standing Committee,” referring to the body of senior CCP leaders.<br><br>Yuan Hongbing, the former head of the law school at Peking University and renowned Chinese dissident based in Australia, said on “Pinnacle View” that in the era of CCP head Xi Jinping, especially in recent years, the CCP has once again revived the term “political swindlers.”<br><br>He said he believes that the 5th ranked member of the CCP’s Politburo Standing Committee Cai Qi is responsible for reviving the term.<br><br>“The key reason why Cai Qi has gained Xi Jinping’s favor is that he first proposed and consistently insisted on equating Xi Jinping’s status with Mao Zedong’s, wanting Xi Jinping to be revered as a ‘deity’ of the Communist Party, just like Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong led the CCP to establish a communist dictatorship, and according to the CCP, he made great contributions to the founding of the country. Cai Qi’s narrative is that Xi Jinping saved the CCP, saved the military, and saved the country,” he said.<br><br>Mr. Yuan further explained that Mr. Cai is willing to resort to open struggles within the CCP to target high-ranking officials in the regime who may hold some reservations against Mr. Xi. Therefore, the term “political swindlers” is being used to label anyone who may doubt or question Mr. Xi’s leadership.<br><br>“Moreover, in the process of returning to Mao Zedong’s [communist] orthodoxy, Xi Jinping has thoroughly offended China’s wealthy private entrepreneurs,” he said. “So Xi Jinping’s series of political and economic actions have made him a tyrant. In the history of the CCP, there has never been a dictator as isolated as Xi Jinping. Back then, Mao Zedong still had a group of enthusiastic supporters, such as the so-called Red Guards who were fanatical supporters of Mao. Xi Jinping now has no support from any class or social stratum, which is his biggest crisis.”<br><br>The other ideology is more progressive than the first, which is nostalgia for the pro-reform leader Hu Yaobang within the Party. Back in the 1980s, Mr. Hu went beyond economic reform and favored political reform for China. His death in 1989 directly led to massive student protests for democracy which tragically resulted in the Tiananmen Square Massacre, Mr. Yuan said.<br><br>The Tiananmen Square Massacre was an “empire-strikes-back” moment that marked an end to Mr. Hu’s reforms, he continued. Discussions about his legacy were censored for years as the hard-line authoritarians within the Party killed the hope for democratization in China. Nevertheless, Mr. Yuan believes that there are some within the CCP today who are preparing to raise the banner of Mr. Hu again to challenge Mr. Xi’s tyranny.<br><br>He said, “This is what Xi Jinping is most worried about, or rather, what he is most afraid of, and in my opinion, this trend of history is unstoppable.”<br><br>Regarding Mr. Xi’s insecurities, Ms. Guo said that in an authoritarian system, the greater the power, the more insecure he becomes. The major problem the CCP faces now is economic stagnation or even regression, which may threaten the stability of the regime.<br><br>“For a short-sighted dictator who is desperate to prevent the collapse [of his rule], he must prevent internal opposition, prevent the emergence of ‘political swindlers,’ or immediately eliminate them whenever they appear. Such [internal power] struggles within the CCP will never stop, and ‘political swindlers’ will always emerge under his rule,” she said."}]
