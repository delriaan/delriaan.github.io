But it turns out that nature has also arranged two nests of birds in the busy corners of the city, cutely delivering scenes of caring between mother and offspring, as if to remind everyone not to forget the kindness of their parents in raising them.<br><br>In recent days, red-eared bulbuls and pearl-necked turtle doves were found busy nesting and hatching eggs atop two tall trees next to a footbridge in the eastern district of Hong Kong Island. Epoch Times reporter went to the scene yesterday afternoon to have a look, and he was not alone. Within two hours the scene was filled with over a hundred people. The nascent little chicks in the nest were seen busy opening their mouths and asking for food, while the mother kept chewing the cud and continued feeding them.<br><br>As it is just a few meters between the nests and the overpass, it is not difficult to be spotted by passers-by. Within minutes, it attracted a crowd to take the rare photos. People from the nearby neighborhoods even brought their children to enjoy the scene of seeing adult birds feeding their chicks."}]
