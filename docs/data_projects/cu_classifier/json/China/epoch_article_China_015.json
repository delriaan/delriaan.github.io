This is the inevitable result of the U.S.–China technological war, and it also reflects the increase in hostile competition between the United States and China.”<br><br>Ye Ning, a Chinese-American lawyer, told The Epoch Times on April 30: “Now the United States is paying more attention to [threats from the CCP]. It has begun to tighten all aspects of national security policies and law enforcement.”<br><br>“These Chinese people should be the focus, as medical scientific research under the CCP’s rule has involved too many things that are against humanity, such as the medical research on harvesting human organs from living people and the creation of viruses,“ he said. ”So it is absolutely necessary to treat these people as key screening targets and to monitor them closely.”"}]
