It did not matter what the former leadership wanted. The last ten years have shown what a deft politician Xi Jinping is.”<br><br>Xi’s purge of the Youth League faction did not stop at Mr. Hu Chunhua, but extended to the military.<br><br>Prior to this, Mr. Li Yuchao and his deputy Liu Guangbin, as well as Zhang Zhenzhong, former deputy commander of the Rocket Force, were investigated by the Central Military Commission.<br><br>In October 2023, Defense Minister Li Shangfu was declared removed from office. In December 2023, nine generals from multiple branches of the military and three senior executives from military-industrial enterprises were removed from the National People’s Congress, confirming rumors of their downfall.<br><br>Regarding the series of purges centered on the leadership of the Rocket Force, Yuan Hongbing, a former law professor at Peking University and a renowned dissident living in exile in Australia, told the Epoch Times, “This stems from a small group suspected of being disloyal to Xi Jinping.”<br><br>“Li Yuchao’s secretary reported to the Central Military Commission that Li and the entire upper echelon of the Rocket Force are ’two-faced.' That is, they were politically disloyal. Specifically, they publicly supported Xi Jinping’s strategy of launching a war in the Taiwan Strait, but in private discussions, they agreed with the views of former National Defense University Political Commissar Liu Yazhou, who opposes launching a war,” he said.<br><br>Mr. Li Yuchao’s secretary also reported to the Central Military Commission that Mr. Li Shangfu and Mr. Qin had close ties to the leaders of the Rocket Force and lacked confidence in Xi’s strategy for a war with Taiwan.<br><br>The frequent incidents involving senior officials of the Rocket Force, including those appointed by Xi, show that the CCP leader still harbors suspicions about his surroundings and is clearing out dissidents, including former “heirs apparent,” to consolidate his position.<br><br>Mr. Wuttke said Mr. Hu Chunhua was “insignificant in power seeking” within the CCP.<br><br>Asked about speculation that his writing to Mr. Hu Chunhua, as a Westerner, may have been the catalyst for Xi’s handling of Mr. Hu Chunhua and the subsequent destruction of the Youth League faction, he said, “My letter had zero impact on his career.”"}]
